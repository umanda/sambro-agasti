o Assume that php and MySQL installed and working properly.

    Requirements:
        o php 4.3 or later
        o MySQL 4.1 or later

o Download Sahana latest release (preferably 'stable' version, if available). 
  Please read README file for download instructions.

o Extract the downloaded file to a proper place (if apt-get use, then it'll do it automatically ;-)
  For example, 
  
    /usr/share/capitus

  and create a symlink to exact location,

    ln -s /usr/share/capitus/www/ /var/www/capitus
    
  or even extracting directly to /var/www/ (no syminks is necessary in this case).
  
  
o Try to access CAPITUS from a client machine,

        http://<ip_address_of_the_capitus_machine>capitus/

  If client and server are the same then use loop-back address,

        http://127.0.0.1/capitus/
      
o "CAPITUS Web Setup" will appear on the browser.

o Select appropriate seetings and click on "Setup Database" button. Normally default values will do (remember
  to enter correct password to connect with database).
