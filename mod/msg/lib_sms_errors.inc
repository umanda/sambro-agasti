<?php/** * * This is a SMS error handler, you can create and manage a SMS error message container * and send the errors via SMS to users accessing Sahana through SMS. * Developers should note the fact that, error message length should preferably be less than 160 characters * which is the standard SMS length. Text greater than 160 characters should also be supported but should * ideally be avoided. Make sure you dont print/echo any message in PHP/HTML as this is supposed to be * dealt via an SMS session, so no echoing of messages. Supress all echo strings or use it for debugging only. * Echoing any strings will break the SMS message text formation and break the session resulting in user not * getting any response to his SMS. * * PHP version 4 and 5 * * LICENSE: This source file is subject to LGPL license * that is available through the world-wide-web at the following URI: * http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html * * @package    moduleAPI * @subpackage errors * @author     Ajay Kumar <ajuonline at gmail dot com><aj at mindtakers dot com> * @copyright  Lanka Software Foundation - http://www.opensource.lk * @version    $Id: lib_sms_errors.inc,v 1.3 2008/11/09 10:52:49 ajuonline Exp $ * @license    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) */function _shn_msg_sms_error_code($error_code){    $error_code_messages = array(                                '1' => 'Invalid SMS Keyword Sent.
